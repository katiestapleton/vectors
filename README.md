# vectors

The main focus in vectors in C++. I defined structures, user interfaces, used containers, vectors, quick sort, selection sort, and more. Performance was also important.

The repo focuses on the important aspect of vectors in C++. For college, I was use a partially pre-built code. This looks messy at the moment. For the "FIXMEs", I fixed the fixmes; however, I had to leave them in the code. (Required so my instructor where to look.) I plan to clean this out soon.
